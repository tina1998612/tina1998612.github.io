## Bio
I am now in my third year at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk/), major in [Computer Science](https://www.cse.ust.hk/). I started coding in the competitive programming space at the age of 17. I discovered my passion towards Blockchain and Distributed Consensus at the age of 19, quitted my internship as a Data and AI Associate Consultant at Microsoft, and determined to be a researcher in this field and spread the technology through teaching and writing. 


## Research Interest
Distributed consensus, game theory, cryptography, and security exploits.
