Blockchain Developer & Researcher / Technical writer on Medium with 1.7k subscribers / Amature model & dance lover ;)

## Bio
Graduated from [Taipei First Girls High School](http://www.fg.tp.edu.tw/bin/home.php), I am now a second year student in [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk/), major in [Computer Science](https://www.cse.ust.hk/). I started coding in the [competitve programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming) space at the age of 17. I discovered my passion towards Blockchain and Distributed Consensus at the age of 19, quitted my internship as a Data and AI Associate Consultant at Microsoft, and determined to be a researcher in this field and spread the technology through teaching and writing. Lastly, I am also a Women in Tech advocator who strives to bring in more female in the Technology field! :)   


## Research Interest
Distributed consensus, game theory, cryptography, and security exploits.
